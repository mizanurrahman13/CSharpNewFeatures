It states that don’t repeat yourself what it means it is saying don’t duplicate code , avoid duplication. Purpose is to reduce the redundant code in your application.

Following the DRY Principle can give us following benefits 
1. Improved maintainability of code
2. Reduces the risks of bugs
3. Code becomes easier to understand

If you are not applying DRY Principle you need to test/debug all process separately for similar code. We can fulfil DRY Principle using Inheritance and Polymorphism.

Scenario, if you find yourself in a situation where multiple classes are using same properties then you can create a base class that will contain those repeated properties and you can inherit your class from it.

DRY is not just limited to properties you have to apply at every point to avoid any kind of repetition methods/classes/properties etc.
